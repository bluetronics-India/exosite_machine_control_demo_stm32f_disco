# exosite_machine_control_demo_stm32f_disco
Demo Machine Control Solution for Exosite Murano using ST Micro STM32F746G Discovery Kit

# Use with mbed project:
https://developer.mbed.org/users/maanenson/code/EXOSITE_DISCO-F746NG_MACHINE_DEMO/
Note: Uses device's MAC Address as unique identifier to activate with the system.

# Use this solution template in Murano when creating a new Solution
Note: The script.js file has a hard-coded device identifier.  You'll want to change
this or you'll have to change in the text form field every time you load the web app page.

This solution is a single page web app, it does not have a concept of users or log-ins.  
It is meant to demonstrate interacting with a remote device with Murano Solution APIs.
